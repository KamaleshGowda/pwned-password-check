# Pwned Passwords:
Pwned Passwords are hundreds of millions of real world passwords previously exposed in data breaches. 
  - This exposure makes them unsuitable for ongoing use as they're at much greater risk of being used to take over other accounts. 
  - You can check if your password is pwned or safe to use using this program.
